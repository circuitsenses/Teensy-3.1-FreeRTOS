# Teensy-3.1-FreeRTOS
FreeRTOS running on Teensy 3.1

This repository contains the files required to run FreeRTOS on a Teensy 3.1 board. Use Arduino 1.0.5 IDE. Assuming you already have the Teensy support files installed, take a backup of Teensy3 folder in \Arduino1.0.5\hardware\teensy\cores\

Replace it with the contents of this repository. Open a blank sketch, i mean completely blank, no loop() and no setup() Build & Upload. The LED on Teensy should Blink.
